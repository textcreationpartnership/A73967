         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And where Wee haue alÅ¿o helde it an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice appertayning to Vs, and as a power vnÅ¿eparably annexed to our Crowne and Royall Authoritie, and Å¿uch as our Progenitors, in the happieÅ¿t times haue vÅ¿ed and exerciÅ¿ed, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Å¿peedie, proper, and conuenient remedies (out of our Royall power) in all caÅ¿es of Å¿odaine and extraordinary accidents, and in matters Å¿o variable and irregular in their nature, as are not prouided for by Law, nor can fitly fall vnder the certaine rule of a Law; and yet may greatly import either the preÅ¿eruation and good of Vs and our people, or the publique honour and ornament of Our Kingdome: ForaÅ¿much as Wee haue alÅ¿o bene giuen to vnderÅ¿tand, that there is obÅ¿eruation made, of Å¿ome more generall neglect in obeying Our Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then is fit to be tolerated, We haue likewiÅ¿e held it fit, not only to giue order, for a reuiew of Å¿uch Proclamations as are paÅ¿Å¿ed formerly, but by the deliberate aduice of Our Priuie Councell, and for the reaÅ¿ons that are before mentioned, to determine Å¿uch of them, as are not now thought neceÅ¿Å¿ary, and conuenient for the publicke weale, and to alter and reforme others, where Wee found cauÅ¿e. Hereby requiring and commanding all our louing Subiects, more duely and readily hereafter to apply their obedience to the reÅ¿t, which Wee doe leaue now in force, or Å¿hall hereafter Å¿et foorth, according to the moÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿ary and important occaÅ¿ions of this EÅ¿tate.</p>

And therefore whereas in the firÅ¿t yeere of our Raigne, a Proclamation was Å¿et foorth touching the prices of Victuals within the Verge; And the like Proclamation was Å¿et foorth the tenth of Iuly in the Å¿econd yere of our Raigne; And that we are giuen to vnderÅ¿tand, that Å¿uch abuÅ¿es may be for the moÅ¿t part reformed, and the Offenders puniÅ¿hed by the Law; Wee doe declare both the Å¿aid Proclamations to be determined.</p>
            <p>And whereas a Proclamation was Å¿et foorth, bearing date the eleueuth day of Ianuarie in the firÅ¿t yeere of Our Reigne, concerning the choiÅ¿e of Knights and BurgeÅ¿Å¿es of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, wherein were contained diuers politique and neceÅ¿Å¿ary directions and admonitions, for caution and reÅ¿pect to be vÅ¿ed in the Å¿aid Elections; ForaÅ¿much as it did referre properly to the Å¿ummons of the Parliament now paÅ¿t long Å¿ince; Wee doe by theÅ¿e preÅ¿ents declare the Å¿aid Proclamation to be determined.</p>
            <p>And wheras a Proclamation was Å¿et forth by Vs, bearing date the eighteenth day of Iune in the Å¿econd yeere of our Reigne, for the true winding and folding of woolles; ForaÅ¿much as the abuÅ¿es (therein mentioned) are partly holpen by the Law, as it now Å¿tandeth, and if any thing be defectiue, it is more fit for a remedie by Acte of Parliament; We doe by theÅ¿e preÅ¿ents determine the Å¿ame.</p>
            <p>And whereas there hath bin Å¿et forth by vs (taking light from the example of our deare SiÅ¿ter Elizabeth,) foure Å¿euerall Proclamations touching buildings and Inmates in and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Citie of London, greatly importing not onely the health, good eÅ¿tate, Å¿afetie, and beautie of the Å¿aid Citie, but likewiÅ¿e by an infallible conÅ¿equence, the vniuerÅ¿all weale and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eruation of our PerÅ¿on, Court, and Kingdome: Wee haue thought fit for the better execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the good therby intended, to draw all the Å¿aid Proclamations into one briefe and cleare forme, which our Princely ReÅ¿olution is to haue hereafter Å¿traitly obÅ¿erued, although Wee could wiÅ¿h that Å¿ome things in that behalfe might be further conÅ¿idered by our Parliament, Å¿eeing the matter hath beene Å¿o often moued, and neuer effected. And whereas We haue alÅ¿o Å¿et foorth diuers Proclamations forbidding the making of Starch, wherein there may Å¿eeme to be Å¿ome ambiguitie; We haue thought fit to determine all the Å¿aide Proclamations in that behalfe, minding to publiÅ¿h one other for the repreÅ¿Å¿ing of Å¿o great an enormitie.</p>
            <p>We haue alÅ¿o taken into our Princely conÅ¿ideration, the neceÅ¿Å¿ity of taking Å¿ome politique or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der againÅ¿t exceÅ¿Å¿e of Apparel, for the inlarging the vent of Cloth, for furniÅ¿hing of the Realme with Å¿eruiceable Armour, for Å¿tay of tranÅ¿porting of Our TreaÅ¿ure into forraine parts, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t Å¿elling of Ships, and for reÅ¿traint and preuention of Depredations at Sea; Some of which points are not at this time prouided for, neither by Law nor Proclamation, and Å¿ome other are not Å¿o Å¿ufficiently and Å¿euerely prouided for, as the greatneÅ¿Å¿e of the miÅ¿chiefe requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. But becauÅ¿e we are willing to make triall, whether the remedies for theÅ¿e great enor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mities may not be reduced vnder Å¿ome regular forme of Law, Wee haue forborne for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent to giue order in them by way of Proclamation.</p>
